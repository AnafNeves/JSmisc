# JSmisc

![Sync](https://github.com/RealityBending/JSmisc/workflows/Sync/badge.svg)

A repo containing useful JavaScript scripts that can be loaded from URL.

## Aim

Long story short, JavaScript scripts can't be loaded directly from a GitHub URL, unless there are obtained through a "GitHub page". This is what this repo enables: the JS scripts are available through this URL: https://realitybending.github.io/JSmisc/

## Usage

For instance, to load the script [`jspsych_extensions/image-buttonkeyboard-response.js`](https://github.com/RealityBending/JSmisc/blob/main/jspsych_extensions/image-buttonkeyboard-response.js), one can add `<script src="https://realitybending.github.io/JSmisc/jspsych_extensions/image-buttonkeyboard-response.js"></script>` in their HTML's head.

This allows you to not clutter your own website with these scripts, and to stay up to date.
